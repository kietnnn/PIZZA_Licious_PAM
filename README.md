 ================================ INTRODUCTION ==========================
   
- Welcome to the project "PizzaLicious.PAM,". 
- The PAM or "Pizza Automatic Machine" is a technology system that allows customers to create and customize their own pizza. 
- Everyone is welcome to view and use the project, and feel free to give some feedback if you aren't satisfied.
- I am open to receiving any positive feedback that helps me improve my invention.

================================ DEVELOPMENT ==========================
   
  
- The Dell laptop and some research tools are my assistance to help me finish my project in a week.
- I also appreciate the care and support from everyone around me, although I don't often communicate or chit-chat with them.
- The new knowledge that I learn in a few weeks, like OOC, drawing diagrams, or "Package", is an important factor in my project.
- My work gets heavily inspired by other works, like the list below:
